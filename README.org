=jda-minor-mode= is a minor-mode for all developers written by Lee
Jong-Gyu.  I was deeply impressed by TextMate and Visual Assist. I
wanted to develop a minor-mode in Emacs. No doubt you will always
enjoy writing a source code in any language if you use
=jda-minor-mode=.

* Quick setup
  Download =jda-minor-mode=
  : ~$ git clone git://github.com/jglee1027/jda-minor-mode.git

  Add the following in ~/.emacs
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "~/jda-minor-mode")
  : (require 'jda)
  : (jda-minor-mode)

* Features
** Easily build
   If there is Makefile in your project or .xcodeproj, you can build a
   project easily by pressing =C-c c= in any subdirectory of your
   project.

** Find development doucmentation
   Press =C-c h= at the symbol which you want to find in a development
   documentation(Android or Xcode).

** Rapidly open a counterpart file
   You can quickly open the counterpart of the current buffer by
   pressing =C-c j p=. In other words, if the current buffer is c or
   cpp source file, you can easily visit the header file related it by
   pressing =C-c j p=.

** Briefly find out lines containing a symbol
   You can simply search positions which a symbol at point is used in
   your project by pressing =C-c j s=. It uses (grep-find).

** Quickly find a file
   You can rapidly find a file in your project by pressing =C-c j f=.

** Quickly visit a file in your project
   You can easily open the file you want to visit in your project by
   pressing =C-c j i= or =C-c i=. It supports incremental search like
   TextMate or Visual Assist. As you type text, one or more possible
   matches for the text are found and immediately displayed.

** Find a symbol in your project
   If you want to find a symbol in your project, press =C-c j s=.
   After finding it, you can easily navigate the symbols by pressing
   =M-g p= or =M-g n=.
   
** Rapidly go to a symbol in the current buffer
   Press =C-c j m= or =C-c m= if you want to go to a function. You can
   see all functions defined in the current buffer. It supports
   incremental search like TextMate or Visual Assist.

** Easily replace a string in several files
   If you want to replace a string in several files, press =C-c j 5=
   or =C-c j %=. You can easily replace a string in specified files in
   your project.

** Easily create a TAG in your project
   Press =C-c j t= and you can easily create TAG file in your project
   using 'find' and 'etags'.
   
** Go to previous or next marker
   Press =C-c ,= to go to the previous marker and Press =C-c .= to go
   to the next marker.
   Press =C-x <down>= to save the current marker.
   
** Highlight symbol
   If you want to see highlighted symbol at point, press =C-c j h=.
   After specified idle time, the current symbol at point is
   highlighted.  It only works in file buffer.
   
** Insert or Delete a bracket in Objective-C mode
   Press =C-c ]= to insert a right bracket to pair.
   Press =C-c [= to delete left and right brackets to pair.
